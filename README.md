# tg_bot
 bot for Turin Library
install 
pip install -m requirements.txt
after create 2 folders : files, first_pages

in the conf.py there os.environ['EMAIL_USER'], os.environ['EMAIL_PASSWORD'] you should define it in os your email and password(it not that password what you use for login)
I guess that all what you should know.


Good luck  Dont forget give a rate!!!
